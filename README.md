Hangman Game
<br>
Description:
<br>
This C++ Hangman game challenges players to guess a randomly selected country or city name from a list. The game, featuring a graphical hangman figure, allows users a maximum of 11 chances to guess the word. Notably, the implementation avoids using string functions, enhancing the project's emphasis on fundamental programming concepts. The console-based interface provides visual feedback on the word's progress and the remaining attempts, creating an engaging user experience. Sound effects, like beeping, add an extra layer of immersion.

Robot Avoiding System
<br>
Description:
<br>
The Robot Avoiding System, also coded in C++, simulates a robot's obstacle avoidance capabilities. Using four distance sensors for North, West, South, and East directions, the program makes the robot navigate its environment. The simulation runs for five moves, presenting sensor readings and the chosen direction based on the furthest distance from obstacles. This project illustrates basic programming concepts and decision-making in robotics, with a focus on fundamental skills.
